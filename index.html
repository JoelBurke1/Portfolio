<h1>The Art Of Coding</h1>
<h3>By: Joel Burke</h3>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Beginning the path of Web Design as a beginner is like stepping into a universe of limitless possibility. It's a language that allows you to interact with machines, 
giving them instructions to carry out tasks and realize your ideas. 
The first attempts may look like examining hieroglyphics, 
with syntax errors acting as your sworn enemies. </p>  
<p>One line at a time, though, you start to solve the mysteries of code with persistence and patience. A great feeling of accomplishment is felt with every little achievement, 
whether it's coding your first "Hello, World!" program or figuring out an easy algorithm. 
Coding is more than just learning a skill; it's about unleashing your imagination, 
finding solutions to challenges encountered in the real world, 
and becoming a part of a global community of fellow learners and developers.</p>
